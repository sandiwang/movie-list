<h1>Top Ten Movies in 2015</h1>
<h4>Angular Skills Demonstration</h4>

<p>This is a demonstration site for my learning of Angular. This site reads from a local JSON file which includes the list of top ten movies in 2015 and retrieves details of each movie from IMDB through OMDB API. Still working on responsiveness.

Also, all the photos are from IMDB. I do not own the copyrights.</p>
